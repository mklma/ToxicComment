# Toxic Comment Classification
In the internet world, those offensive, rude, or threatening written comments during online conversation may much likely stop people from free discussion and expression.  Such toxic comments have severely affected the healthy development of online community.  To detect these toxic comments and classify them into different types of toxicity is a prerequisite for any actions taken to prevent such negative behaviours.

Hence, this project is aiming to build a classifier which can not only identify toxic ones from arbitrary comments, but categorise them into different types of toxicity in order to facilitate the further actions against certain behaviours.
